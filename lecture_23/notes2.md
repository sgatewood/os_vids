# Problem
- C sent commit
- Worker/network fails
- Need to get C to resend commit message (can't abort now)

# Strategies
1. W resends agree-to-commit vote
2. C resends outcome somehow? (But how would it know?)

# C resending outcomes
- Have workes acknowledge the Commit message
    - Assignment: Whether or not you returned
