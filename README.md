Enhanced OS Videos

Obvious credits for the actual videos to Professor Charles Reiss. 

(This is just some HTML and JQuery that loads particular sections of the lecture videos, with the intention of dividing them up.)

# Notes

- I'm still working on this, so some of these are much better than others. The ones with checkmarks have been finalized.
- The green bar should be clickable.
- "Go Back" just refreshes the page, so you can also just do that. :p
- If focused on a video, you can press X to restart the segment
- I would recommend downloading [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en) (and keep it, so you can speed through ads).
- Much of this was hastily coded, so I'm sorry if it explodes on you. It seems to work for me in Google Chrome.
