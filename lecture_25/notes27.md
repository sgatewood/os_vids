# Hardware Hypervisor support (not on exam)
- Common in modern processors
- Benefits:
    - Lets processor be in kernel mode but still switch to VM monitor when something important happens
        - Processor will track User/Kernel mode PTEs for you (don't need separate shadow PT's for these)
    - Lets you configure when to run hypervisor
        - HW can run guest handlers, and specify which things go to hypervisor
    - Nested page table support
        - HW will do 2 page table lookups itself (to help with Virtual Machines)
        - Even tho this is super complicated in the HW
- Why VMs are much faster today
